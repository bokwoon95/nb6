/admin/rssreader/ is a pseudo-folder (it does not reside in the file system, but rather the database? or can it be in the file system?) reserved for the rss reader feed

TODO: don't make the logout button so close to the Create Note/ Create Post button. Bury it inside a details/summary menu and put the users link inside as well.
TODO: /admin/createfile/ and /admin/createfolder/ should use centered-body format instead, just like /admin/login/. However make sure the words "Create Post" or "Create File" are featured very prominently as <h1>s or else it would look too much like a login form. For "Create Post" and "Create Note", it should not display to a post/note creation page but rather create a new post/note under the hood and redirect the user to that post/note. Then when you exit, it should show multiple "Untitled" posts and notes. And the user should be able to select all of them, click a context menu and bulk delete.

- wire up the alert dismissal button (CSS + JS)
TODO: notFound(w, r) and internalServerError(w, r), which contain go-back links as well as a more descriptive error message (and notebrew headers).
