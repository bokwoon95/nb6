/admin/rssreader/ is a pseudo-folder (it does not reside in the file system, but rather the database? or can it be in the file system?) reserved for the rss reader feed

TODO: finish up dir and make sure it shows buttons accordingly. It helps to create some dummy entries in notes/, pages/, posts/ and themes/ first so that we can get the display (GET requests) working right, then slowly decide on how to craft the POST requests for creating files/folders as well as editing, deleting and renaming them (checkboxes and stuff).

TODO: rate limiting failed logins (keyed by username, IP address)
