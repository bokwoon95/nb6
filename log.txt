/admin/feed/ is a pseudo-folder (it does not reside in the file system, but rather the database? or can it be in the file system?) reserved for the rss reader feed

TODO: add logos: folder, html, css, js, md, txt, img, font, etc

TODO: We need a good enough feedback/response system such that when a user clicks on 'delete' or 'cut' or 'copy' without any file selected, we can redirect back to that page with a flash session set.

New File | New Folder | Delete | Cut | Copy
Name | Size | Delete | Rename | Cut | Copy

Restriction 1: Needs to be pure HTML/CSS.
Restriction 2: Needs to be functional even without CSS i.e. rely on tags for certain properties like block level elements, instead of bodging inline-block elements into block elements using CSS.
