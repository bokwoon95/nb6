/admin/rssreader/ is a pseudo-folder (it does not reside in the file system, but rather the database? or can it be in the file system?) reserved for the rss reader feed

TODO: don't make the logout button so close to the Create Note/ Create Post button. Bury it inside a details/summary menu and put the users link inside as well.
TODO: /admin/createfile/ and /admin/createfolder/ should use centered-body format instead, just like /admin/login/. However make sure the words "Create Post" or "Create File" are featured very prominently as <h1>s or else it would look too much like a login form. For "Create Post" and "Create Note", it should not display to a post/note creation page but rather create a new post/note under the hood and redirect the user to that post/note. Then when you exit, it should show multiple "Untitled" posts and notes. And the user should be able to select all of them, click a context menu and bulk delete.
TODO: createnote.go
TODO: tweak file.html
- wire up the alert dismissal button (CSS + JS)
- rethink the "5 items cut" prompt. I think I want to remove the button styling, make it all links with good padding apart so it's not easy to fat-finger "paste here" and "clear clipboard". something like this: [5 items cut]   [paste here]   [clear]. Paste here will be a dark green with a lightening on hover and active, clear will be a dark red with a lightening on hover and active. I'm mostly worried that it will be still too easy to fat finger "paste here" and "clear clipboard".
TODO: file.html in mobile view the buttons don't flex-wrap over properly rather they jut out all ugly into the alert bubble :/
TODO: if I can break free of the tyranny of the "h2" height limit, I can make the buttons look nicer using this active/passive style (https://medium.com/@cirrus/a-tale-of-two-buttons-e63185aefd5f). Paste would be the active button, Clear would be the passive button.
